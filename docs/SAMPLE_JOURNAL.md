# What the journal reads like

This is what `data/journal.jsonl` is supposed to read like once Fotis
is running. The lines below are illustrative, not real. They give a
sense of the diary the experiment is building.

Each line is one tick. Times are simulated.

## What good looks like

* Long runs of `noop`. Boredom is correct.
* The humidity cycle is visible: drops through the day, spikes after
  the evening mist, drifts back overnight.
* Lights flip exactly once at day start and once at night start.
* CGD refresh is one or two times per day, never more.
* Insect feeds are concentrated in the evening, never more than 1 to
  2 per week.
* The mist actions cluster in the evening with a small top-up before
  dawn. Not scattered through the day.
* Safety overrides are rare and always preceded by an `alert_human`
  that Fotis raised on its own.
* When the keeper does the daily check, the journal explains itself.
