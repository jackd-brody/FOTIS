"""Day / night phase helpers.

A four-state model fits crested gecko behaviour better than just
day / night:

  dawn      transition: lights start to come up
  day       active period for the keeper, gecko hiding
  dusk      transition: lights start to come down, gecko stirs
  night     gecko active, IR camera on

The transitions are short windows around the lights-on and lights-off
times. Fotis uses them to ramp behaviour, not flip it.
